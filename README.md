# ME35 LEGO Leg Project

This project aims to control a LEGO leg remotely so it moves forward about 10cm.   
1. Use MATLAB to find leg's path curve and then use inverse kinematics to find the angles of the leg's two joints to complete theis path
2. Use Python to control Arduino Nano RP2040 so it talks to a broker which controls the leg and Adafruit IO which stores the angles
