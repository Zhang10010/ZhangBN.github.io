# Purpose
1st: Use cubic spline to find path curve using approximated points.   
2nd: Find angles of a two-joints robotic arm/leg for this path.   

# MATLAB Files

Heart: Draws a heart path and calculates angles required to follow it   
Path: Draws a path for a leg to move forward about 10cm and calculates angles required to follow it
